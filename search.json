I transform raw data into actionable insights, blending technical expertise with creative strategy to drive impactful solutions.\n\n\nI hold a Master of Science in Digital Marketing from Cal Poly Pomona, and I bring a unique blend of skills in R programming, Python, and web analytics to every project. Whether it’s through building interactive dashboards, delivering hands-on workshops, or publishing reproducible research, I thrive on turning complex data into clear, compelling narratives.\n\n\n\nI am a strong advocate for reproducible research, and I harness modern tools like Quarto to create dynamic, transparent documents and websites. By integrating code, narrative, and visualizations, Quarto empowers me to develop work that is easily updated, shared, and verified. This approach not only enhances the integrity of my research but also makes it accessible to collaborators and the broader community.\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis & Visualization: Creating interactive and informative visualizations using R and Python.\nDigital Marketing Strategies: Leveraging web analytics, SEO, and targeted campaigns to boost online presence.\nWorkshops & Training: Delivering engaging, hands-on workshops that empower professionals to harness the power of data.\nReproducible Reporting: Building seamlessly integrated documents and reports using Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA digital hub for preserving and sharing cherished family memories, The Chubb Archive curates old physical films that have been digitized and hosted on YouTube. I built thechubbarchive.com as an organized gateway to these films, integrating Google Analytics to track and confirm engagement from family members across various states.\n\n\n\nIn my role as an Analyst, I revolutionized the process of defining military installation market areas. Previously, data was manually recorded—a time-consuming and hazardous method. I developed a Shiny R app that integrates with Strava to automatically capture GPS data during field drives. By leveraging the sf and leaflet packages along with the HERE API, the app produces an interactive map that improves both the accuracy and safety of data collection.\n\n\n\nTasked with organizing and categorizing flagged data from a large, complex database, I noticed that team morale was suffering due to the overwhelming volume of work. To address this, I created a straightforward yet effective dashboard that displays key metrics and a visual history of the team’s progress. This tool not only streamlined data processing but also boosted team motivation by clearly showcasing achievements over time.\nExplore Projects\n\n\n\n\nI’m always looking to collaborate and share ideas.
